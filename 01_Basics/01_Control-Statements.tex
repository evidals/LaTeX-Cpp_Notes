\section{Control Statements}

C++ has 3 kind of control statements:(i) selection statementes, (ii) iteration statements and (iii) jump statements. It is said that most programs are formed by combining as many of these statements. Each control statement can be modelled as an activity diagram using \ac{UML}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item selection statement: \texttt{if}-\texttt{else}, and \texttt{switch}.
    \item iteration statement or loops: \texttt{while}, \texttt{do-while}, \texttt{for}, \texttt{range-based} (special \texttt{for}).
    \item jump statements: \texttt{break}, \texttt{continue}, \texttt{return} and \texttt{goto}.
\end{itemize}
